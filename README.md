# River

River is a project made for Hack the Hill 2023. This project was made by Krish Krish, Rachelle DeMan and Arian Ahmadinejad.

## What's next for River
We plan to make River into a full fledged application, capable of supporting tens of thousands of users. In the near future, we plan on creating attendee accounts, equipped with dashboards and easy autofill for River events. We also plan to add custom RSVP settings, custom styles, phone confirmations as an alternative to email, and more detailed analytics.
